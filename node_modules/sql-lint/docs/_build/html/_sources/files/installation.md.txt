# Installation

Installation is simple. Download a pre-built
[binary](https://github.com/joereynolds/sql-lint/releases) from Github. Once
you've installed `sql-lint`, you will want to [configure it](./configuration.md) for the best
experience.

`sql-lint` supports Mac, Linux, and Windows.

If you prefer, you can do `npm i -g sql-lint` or `yarn global add sql-lint` if you're using yarn.

## Programmatic Access

For programmatic access you'll want to instead install `sql-lint` into your node project with `npm i sql-lint` or `yarn add sql-lint`.
